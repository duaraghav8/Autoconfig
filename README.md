# Autoconfig
Automate the manual process of IP and DNS Configuration, which is required at some places whose network can only be accessed via static IP address. I created this primarily for students of my college living in private hostels (around 60% live in private hostels) who need to change configurations daily depending on whether they wish to use University or hostel network.

This application was programmed in C++ in Visual Studio and uses **netsh** commandline tool available in windows. It generate 2 batch script which are executed upon clicking of their corresponding button. Remember to run the application as Administrator.
